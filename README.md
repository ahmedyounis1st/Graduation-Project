Simply this is my graduation project.

## Predicting A Disease Based on The Diagnosis of Another Disease Using Machine Learning.   
+ Our project is about predicting a disease based on the diagnosis of another disease using machine learning , to help in early diagnosis of disease by supporting the pathologists and doctors in their decision , our idea is to diagnosis of chronic kidney disease (CKD) as well as predicting other diseases, such as Coronary artery disease (CAD).

## Tools Used:
+ Python
+ Machine Learning
+ Django
+ CSV Files
+ HTML/CSS
